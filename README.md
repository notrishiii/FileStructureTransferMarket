# FileStructureTransferMarket
Transfer Market is a distributed application, developed to maintain the transfer details of players playing in different clubs in the world. It is based on a concept to store and generate all the records of the players. This program is considered as a simple database of players where, the admin can add player data, rumours, transfer details and the user can only view it. It is user friendly and just asks the user to follow step by step operations by giving him few options. Here at first, the user has to pass through login system to get access to the database where he/she can view list of players, their market value and transfer rumours. In this world of growing technologies everything has been computerized. Thus, there is a need of a system which can handle the data of such a large number of players. This project simplifies the task of maintain records because of its user-friendly nature. It just asks the user to follow step by step operations by giving him few options. The whole project is designed in ‘JAVA’ language and different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. This project is easy to operate and understood by the users. This project is developed using Java Swings in NetBeans. In the project we have used file structure concept of indexing and B-Trees.
